# Personal Portfolio Website

#
# This is a personal project to build a portfolio website to market my skills and achievements to employers.
#
#
#
# PLANNING:
# 3 things to think about before I start building:
#  
# 1:
# What do you want your website to show? - I want my website to:
- show my online profile to future prospective employers. 
- allow an employer to contact me. - ideas:
- - A button to send a message to me directly with a text field for the email body.
- ?
#
# 2:
# Do you want to be able to post code snips, showcase entire projects, or just give a brief summary of what you can do? - I want to:
- post code snips
- showcase entire projects
- ?
# 
# 3:
# Do you want to be able to post any type of blog\tutorial?
- a forum or blog might work. It would take a time investment to maintain.
